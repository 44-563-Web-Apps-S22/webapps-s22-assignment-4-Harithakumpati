    <h4> SCENE V (Dorante, Covielle) </h4>

    <h6>COVIELLE:</h6>
    <p>Ha, ha, ha! My faith, that was hilarious. What a dupe! If
        he had learned his role by heart, he could not have played it
        better. Ah! Ah! Excuse me, Sir, Wouldn't you like to help us here
        in an affair that is taking place.</p>
    <h6>DORANTE:</h6>   
    <p>Ah! Ah! Covielle, who would have recognized you? How you
        are made up!</p> 
    <h6>COVIELLE:</h6>    
    <p>You see, ha, ha!</p>
    <h6>DORANTE:</h6>
    <p>What are you laughing at?</p>
    <h6>COVIELLE:</h6>
    <p>At a thing, Sir, that well deserves it.</p>
    <h6>DORANTE:</h6>
    <p>What?</p>
    <h6>COVIELLE:</h6>
    <p>I'll give you many chances, Sir, to guess the stratagem
        we are using on Monsieur Jourdain to get him to give his daughter
        to my master.</p>
    <h6>DORANTE:</h6>   
    <p>I can't begin to guess the stratagem, but I guess it will
        not fail in its effect, since you are undertaking it. </p>
    <h6>COVIELLE:</h6>    
    <p>I see, Sir, that you know me too well.</p>
    <h6>DORANTE:</h6>
    <p>Tell me what it is.</p>
    <h6>COVIELLE:</h6>
    <p>Come over here a little to make room for what I see
        coming. You can see part of the story, while I tell you the rest.</p>
